User Authentication: 
Allow users to sign up as either employers or job seekers. You can use Next.js authentication libraries 
like NextAuth.js or implement custom authentication using JWT.

Job Listings: 
Employers can create job listings by filling out a form with details such as 
job title, description, requirements, location, salary, etc. These listings should be stored in a database (e.g., MongoDB) and displayed on the platform for job seekers to browse.

Search and Filter: 
Implement a search functionality where job seekers can search for jobs based on keywords,
 location, industry, etc. Additionally, provide filtering options to narrow down search results.

Job Alerts: 
Allow job seekers to set up job alerts based on their preferences.
 When a new job listing matches their criteria, they should receive email notifications.

Resume Uploads:
 Job seekers can upload their resumes to their profiles. 
 You can use a file storage service like AWS S3 to store resume files securely.

Apply to Jobs: 
Job seekers should be able to apply to job listings directly through the platform. This might involve filling out an application form and attaching their resume. Employers should receive notifications when someone applies to their job listings.

Employer Profiles:
 Employers should have profiles where they can manage their job listings, view applicant resumes, and communicate with job seekers. Include features like company description, logo upload, and contact information.

Messaging System:

 Implement a messaging system that allows communication between employers and job seekers. 
 This could include features like real-time chat, message history, and notifications for new messages.

Analytics Dashboard: 
Provide employers with analytics on their job listings, such as the number of views, applications, and conversion rates. 
This will help them optimize their hiring process.

Responsive Design:
 Ensure that the job board is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
